There are three breaking changes in this release:
* Upgrading Kotlin version from 1.1 to 1.2
* CompileOptions and EvaluationSession builder api
* Case insensitive identifiers

# Upgrading Kotlin version from 1.1 to 1.2
If your package does not have koltin code or depend on other kotlin packages no change code change should be necessary.
For Kotlin packages or that have other Kotlin dependencies they will need to upgrade to Kotlin 1.2 as well, see
https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Kotlin/Upgrading_to_1.2 for more details

# CompileOptions and EvaluationSession builder api
`CompileOptions` builder API is now consistent with `EvaluationSession` with the following `@JvmStatic` Companion methods:

* `CompileOptions.Companion.build(block: Builder.() -> Unit)` a Kotlin style builder
method using [function literal with receivers](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html#function-literals-with-receiver)
* `CompileOptions.Companion.builder(): Builder` a fluent Java style builder method   

`CompileOptions.default()` and `EvaluationSession.default()` where renamed to `CompileOptions.standard()` and
`EvaluationSession.standard()` as `default` is a reserved keyword in Java

# Case insensitive identifiers
With version 2.x IonSql identifiers are now case insensitive unless double quoted. Examples:
Given an environment consisting of:
```ion
{
  a: 1,
  A: 2
}
```
* `"a"` evaluates to `1`
* `"A"` evaluates to `2`
* `a` is ambiguous and results in an error
* `A` is ambiguous and results in an error

Some SFW query examples:
```sql
SELECT my_data.name FROM `{name: 'john doe'}` as MY_DATA -- works as `my_data` identifier is case insensitive
SELECT "my_data".name FROM `{name: 'john doe'}` as MY_DATA -- throws as `"my_data"` identifier is case sensitive

SELECT my_data.name FROM `{NAME: 'john doe'}` as my_data -- works as `name` path is case insensitive
SELECT my_data.name FROM `{name: 'john doe', NAME: 'jane doe'}` as my_data -- throws as `name` path is case sensitive and ambiguous
```

The following API changes were necessary to implement this change
* `Bindings` interface now requires a `BindingName` class that encapsulates the necessary data to perform a binding lookup. API changes:
  * `Bindings.Companion.over(func: (String) -> ExprValue?) : Bindings` to `Bindings.Companion.over(func: (BindingName) -> ExprValue?) : Bindings`
  * `Bindings.get(bindingName: String): ExprValue?` to `Bindings.get(bindingName: BindingName): ExprValue?`
  * `fun binderForName(bindingName: String): (List<ExprValue>) -> ExprValue?` to `fun binderForName(bindingName: BindingName): (List<ExprValue>) -> ExprValue?`

## AST changes
To support case insensitive and case sensitive identifiers the following changes were added to the AST:

`id` nodes now have a 3rd element signaling if they are `case_sensitive` or `case_insensitve`, example: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table 
-- before (select (project (*)) (from (id my_table)))
-- now (select (project (*)) (from (id my_table case_insensitive)))
```

`path` nodes have their `lit` nodes wrapped by a `case_sensitive` or `case_insensitive` node, example:
```sql
a.b
-- before (path (id a) (lit "b"))
-- now (path (id a case_insensitive) (case_insensitive (lit "b")))
```
