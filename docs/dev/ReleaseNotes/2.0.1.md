Hi,

The Ion Team would like to announce a new version release for IonSQL++ in live, [v2.0.1](https://code.amazon.com/packages/IonSQLSandbox/releases/2.x.9.0)

This is a **BugFix** version release and includes the following [changes](https://code.amazon.com/packages/IonSQLSandbox/commits/533f2b07a5ee52e3bb9a0d75214d3fc2acd04a7c#)

* IONSQL-257-repl-hotfix

This issue only affects the REPL build, **it does not** affect clients that use IonSQL++ as a library

Thanks to everyone for their help and support.
