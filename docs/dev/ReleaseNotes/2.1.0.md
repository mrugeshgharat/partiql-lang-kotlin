Hi, 

The Ion Team would like to announce a new version release for IonSQL++ in `live`, v2.1.0!

Although there are no breaking API changes in this release, the following changes may result in different behavior 
of executed SQL and were included to improve SQL-92 compliance. 

- [SUBSTRING now requires integer instead of any numeric type](https://code.amazon.com/packages/IonSQLSandbox/commits/6e4dfae20c56792b8e065e6025f1ca13b561c771#)
- [EXTRACT function now returns default values for timestamp fields when the timestamp has a precision lower than the requested field](https://code.amazon.com/packages/IonSQLSandbox/commits/6ecf875ce40005d3d2bc56d80a63a6b9bbd57f82#)
- [TO_TIMESTAMP will no longer accept certain format patterns that it used to accept](https://code.amazon.com/packages/IonSQLSandbox/commits/6fbbeaf69d485ac89c95951924431b867ba99b8e#)  The format patterns now blocked are described in the following SIM issues:
  - https://issues.amazon.com/issues/IONSQL-282
  - https://issues.amazon.com/issues/IONSQL-131
  - https://issues.amazon.com/issues/IONSQL-130
  - https://issues.amazon.com/issues/IONSQL-266
- [Proper support for SELECT *] (https://code.amazon.com/packages/IonSQLSandbox/commits/c68b30fc384dc87843839907e740a022390cd95c#) required blocking of path expressions containing wildcards in a select list and changing the meaning of `SELECT alias.*`.
